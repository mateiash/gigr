# gigr

`gigr` is a command-line interface tool for playing music, written in Rust. It's simple, but development has not yet been completed :D! There are more features planned.

For now, it automatically scans your `~/Music` folder for its supported formats (`flac`, `wav` and `mp3`) and adds them all in a queue, but loading of albums and artists is also planned for implementation.

Commands are:
* `j` - volume down
* `k` - volume up
* `l` - skip track
* `space` - play/pause

This project is intended for use on GNU/Linux systems and can be built with Cargo.

Thanks!
